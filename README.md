## INTRODUCTION TO ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
Asymmetric cryptography is a branch of cryptography where a secret key can 
be divided into two parts, a public key and a private key. The public key can be 
given to anyone, trusted or not, while the private key must be kept secret (just 
like the key in symmetric cryptography).

Asymmetric cryptography has two primary use cases: authentication and 
confidentiality. Using asymmetric cryptography, messages can be signed with a 
private key, and then anyone with the public key is able to verify that the 
message was created by someone possessing the corresponding private key. 
This can be combined with a proof of identity system to know what entity 
(person or group) owns that private key, providing authentication.

Encryption with asymmetric cryptography works in a slightly different way 
from symmetric encryption. Someone with the public key can encrypt a 
message, providing confidentiality, and then only the person in possession of 
the private key is able to decrypt it.

What is RSA algorithm?‚ô®
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that 
it uses a public key and a private key (i.e., two different, mathematically linked 
keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private 
key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.
